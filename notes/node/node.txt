NodeJS
    - an open source, cross-platform js runtime environment
        - allows us to run JS outside of the browser
    - allows us to use js for every tier of an application
NVM
    - Node Version Manager
    - allows us to switch between node versions

NPM
    - Node Package Manager
    - one of the world's largest software registries
    - free to use
    - 3 main components
        - website
            - navigate, discover packages
        - cli
            - npm command
        - registry
            - database of js software available for download
        - npm init
            - initializes a new js project
            - generates the package.json
                - like pom.xml for js
                - lists dependencies used
                - also metadata about the project itself
        - node_modules
            - folder that contains all of the dependencies required to run an npm project
            - when cloning an npm project, run npm install to install the dependencies locally
            - good practice is to use .gitignore the node_modules folder
        - package-lock.json
            - specifies the exact version of the dependencies and required subdependencies so that the project is 100% reproducable

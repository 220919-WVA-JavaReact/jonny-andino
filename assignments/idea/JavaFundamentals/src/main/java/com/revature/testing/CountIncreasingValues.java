    /*
    Given an array of numbers, we need to find a way of measuring increasing values
    within the list, and returning the total number of increasing values found in the list.
    For example if we had the array:

    int[] list = {120, 101, 145, 113, 123, 99, 215, 106};

    If we start at the beginning, comparing the first number to it's neighbor,
    we could see that 101 is not greater than 120, so we wouldn't count that.
    Moving along the list we'd see that 145 IS greater than 101, so we would count that,
    and so on.

## Bash Coding Challenge
    
Get and store some data challenge!

Create a shell script that prompts the user for some data (what is asked for is up to you, have fun with it). The data obtained from the user should be properly stored inside of a CSV file so it can be accessed/queries later. Be sure not to overwrite the contents of the CSV file when new data is added.


Example ideas:
- Pokemon data
- MTG data
- bank account information
- any kind of data that you think would be interesting to work with


Required User Stories:
- The User will be given a small menu with options of what to do
- The User will be able to create new data to be stored
- The User will be able to see all data stored formatted in a way that is easy to understand
- The User will be able to select/search for a certain piece of data


Optional User Stories:
- The User will be able to delete a specific piece of data
- The User will be able to change/update a specific piece of data



Submission instructions:
Compress the directory/folder containing your shell script and the CSV file using tar or your operating system's zipping tool and send that file to jonathan.gworek@revature.com with your full name in the email
